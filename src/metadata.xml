    <description>Automatically destroy fires and poops in rooms with no enemies, and destroy rocks and secret room walls if you could destroy them without spending bombs. It saves a lot of time as you don't need to &quot;farm&quot; poops and fires anymore, or look for secret rooms and trapdoors, but keep in mind that it does make it much easier to reach the boss rush and Hush!

You can enable/disable the destruction of fires, poops, rocks and walls using Mod Config Menu Pure https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787. By default, only normal fires, normal poops and golden poops are destroyed.

If you enable the destruction of rocks and walls, they will only be destroyed if you could destroy them without spending a bomb: if have a golden bomb, or if you are stompy, or if you have a passive item that would allow you to destroy them (i.e. all items that turn your tears into bombs or create bombs for free, Sulfuric Acid, and Samson's Chains).

Destroyed poops and rocks will automatically fill holes all around them.</description>
