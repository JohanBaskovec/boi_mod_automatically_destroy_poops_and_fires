    <description>Automatically destroy fires and poops in rooms with no enemies. It saves a lot of time as you don't
        need to "farm" poops and fires anymore, but keep in mind that it does make it much easier to reach the boss rush
        and Hush!

        You can configure which fire and poop types are destroyed by using Mod Config Menu Pure
        https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787. By default, only normal fires, normal poops
        and golden poops are destroyed.

        In the configuration menu, you can also enable the destruction of rocks and secret room walls. They will only
        be destroyed if you could destroy them without spending a bomb: if have a golden bomb, or if you are stompy, or
        if you have a passive item that would allow you to destroy them (i.e. all items that turn your tears
        into bombs and a few others).

        Destroyed poops and rocks will automatically fill holes all around them.
